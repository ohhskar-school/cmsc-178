% TO PREVENT THE THRESHOLD GOING TOO LOW FOR SMALL FILTER SIZES

% CALCULATION. 
threshK=max(1,-0.5*N+7.5); % multiply threshold by this factor

%-----------change code from here --------------------------------

% 1. Create and empty array E and and an array G containing the filtered
%    image (use conv2 with the 'same' option to do this).
E = zeros(size(I));
G = conv2(I, F, 'same');

% 2. compute threshold t (0.75*mean(G)) of the LoG image stored in
%    G (and multiply by threshK)
t = 0.75 * mean(abs(G(:))) * threshK;

% 3. identify the zero crossing points 
% 4. preserve those zero crossing points where the sum of the
%    magnitudes of G accross the zero crossing is > t

% Get half of the distance from the center based on the size of the filter 
halfDist = floor(N/2);

% Create array so that checking each side will be easier

            % If positive, check if one side is negative. If so, a zero
            % crossing is present and is indicated in the edge image.

                edge = G(i + sides(k,1),j + sides(k,2));
